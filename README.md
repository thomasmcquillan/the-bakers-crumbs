# Project Overview
This site was built to provide resources to people who love to bake - both experienced bakers, and also those who would like to bake but maybe lack confidence. It is a welcoming space, where first time vistors can browse existing recipes to get a taste of the site's content. However, the richest experience will become available upon creation of a user account. When logged in to their account, registered users can favourite recipes from other users for easy reference, or even submit their own recipes to share with the community along with a photo, if desired. 

The site owner is a passionate baker and active user of the site, contributing a number of tried and tested recipes. They also take on a curatorial role, with admin priveleges that allow minor editing and categorisation of user-submitted recipes for quality control and improved user experience.
