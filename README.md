# Project Overview
This site was built to provide resources to people who love to bake - both experienced bakers, and also those who would like to bake but maybe lack confidence. It is a welcoming space, where first time vistors can browse existing recipes to get a taste of the site's content. However, the richest experience will become available upon creation of a user account. When logged in to their account, registered users can favourite recipes from other users for easy reference, or even submit their own recipes to share with the community along with a photo, if desired. 

The site owner is a passionate baker and active user of the site, contributing a number of tried and tested recipes. They also take on a curatorial role, with admin priveleges that allow minor editing and categorisation of user-submitted recipes for quality control and improved user experience.

# UX
## User Stories

This site is targeted at experienced bakers and beginner bakers alike. It is a place people can come for inspiration, browsing through the featured recipes. Equally, it is intended as a place for bakers to share their favourite recipes with fellow users. It also seeks to accommodate users who follow special diets, such as vegans, vegetarians or allergy sufferers.

# Design

## Wireframes

### Home Page

##### This page greets site visitors with a quirky design aesthetic, combined with clear, concise navigation bar and links. The page content is neatly contained atop a card - referencing the index-card / catalogue-cards that were often used for sorting recipes in times-past.

![Wireframes for TBC website home-page](docs/images/wireframes-home-page.png)

### View all Recipes & View by Category

##### The wireframes seen below indicate the layout for both 'View all Recipes' and a user's chosen 'Recipes by Category' option, as accessed from the home page. If a category contains more recipes than can be displayed comfortably on a given display, pagination will be utilised for a tidy appearance and reduced dependance on scrolling.

![Wireframes for 'View All Recipes' page](docs/images/wireframes-view-all-recipes.png)

### View Recipe Page

##### The layout of individual recipes is extremely simple and uncomplicated, referencing the recipe-cards of old that were often typed on typewriters - necessitating a basic layout. Recipes that are too long to fit on a single card continue on another.
